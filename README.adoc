A container image for the running the Caddy reverse-proxy complete with the {Caddy-Cloudflare-Module} capable of completing the ACME DNS-01 challenge.

== Synopsis

Image:: https://quay.io/repository/jwillikers/caddy-cloudflare[quay.io/jwillikers/caddy-cloudflare]

Tags::
* `latest`

Supported architectures::
* `amd64` _(x86_64)_
* `arm64` _(aarch64)_

Labels::
`io.containers.autoupdate=registry`::: Enables automatic updates when using {Podman} and the _fully-qualified_ image name.

== Quick Start

I recommend putting the Caddy container along with all of the containers it will proxy on a dedicated CNI network with the DNS plugin enabled.
This makes it easy to delegate to the corresponding containers and doesn't require port-forwarding on their part, which means port address conflicts won't be an issue.
A dedicated CNI network also provides better isolation.
If you need to, you can also use the Caddy container with host networking with other containers using host networking or those using the default `slirp4netns` networking mode.
The example instructions here use CNI networking.

. Allow rootless containers to publish to ports 80 and 443 by lowering the starting port for the range of unprivileged ports.
This makes it possible to run the Caddy container rootless and use the standard HTTP and HTTPS ports.
+
./etc/sysctl.d/99-lower-unprivileged_port_start.conf
[source]
----
; Allow publishing to lower port numbers without requiring superuser privileges.
net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
----

. Load the new sysctl configuration.
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo sysctl --system
----

. Open the default HTTP and HTTPS ports, 80 and 443 respectively, in the firewall, since rootless Podman won't be able to open these ports for the container.
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp --add-port=443/tcp --permanent
----

. Reload the firewall rules that were just saved.
+
[source,sh]
----
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

. Create a new Podman network which will have DNS networking enabled by default.
+
[source,sh]
----
podman network create --ipv6
----

. Make sure to set the CloudFlare TLS encryption mode to `Full (strict)` to avoid problems with Caddy.

. Create a CloudFlare API token for your domain with `Zone:Read` and `DNS:Edit` permissions.

. Store your CloudFlare API token as a Podman secret to avoid exposing it.
+
[source,sh]
----
printf **************************************** | podman secret create CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN -
----

. In your Caddyfile, be sure to provide the Cloudflare token to the module.
Then it's just a matter of proxying to hosts using the network's domain name, `dns.podman` by default.
The following Caddyfile demonstrates enabling the Cloudflare DNS-01 ACME challenge globally and configuring a reverse-proxy to a container running Gitea on the same CNI network.
+
[source]
----
{
	acme_dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
	# For testing
	# acme_ca https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
}

gitea.example {
	reverse_proxy gitea.dns.podman:3000
}
----

. Run Caddy rootless, forwarding the appropriate ports, proving the Cloudflare token secret, and mounting the Caddyfile along with the necessary directories.
+
[source,sh]
----
podman run \
  --detach \
  --label "io.containers.autoupdate=registry" \
  --name caddy \
  --network podman1 \
  --publish 80:80/tcp \
  --publish 443:443/tcp \
  --rm \
  --secret CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN,type=env \
  --volume $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile:Z \
  --volume caddy-config:/config/:Z \
  --volume caddy-data:/data/:Z \
  quay.io/jwillikers/caddy-cloudflare:latest
